# DialLog 0.0.2 - Get to the point

## My 1st Mobile app , a speak/listen call counter that analizes your type of speech attitude in a given conversation

- The idea is to register the amount of time one spends talking in oposition to listening in a given call. The data can be ordered to match contacts and create a historical record of talk/listen times of conversations with a given contact.  
- Patterns of conversation immerge and one can distinguish between passive dialog attitudes and aggressive/impossing ones.  
- The goal of the app is to identify this patterns and help in conversation and communication improvement.
- Silence is also taken in to account for calculations.
