   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DialLog.git
   cd DialLog
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**
   ```bash
   # Open the project in Android Studio
   # Let Gradle sync and install dependencies
   # Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   ```

4. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   # Or run directly from Android Studio
   ```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add tests if applicable

3. **Test your changes**
   - Test on multiple Android versions if possible
   - Test with different device configurations
   - Ensure existing functionality still works

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   # Use conventional commit format if possible
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Language**: Kotlin preferred, Java acceptable
- **Formatting**: Use Android Studio default formatting (Ctrl+Alt+L)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Comments**: Add KDoc comments for public functions and classes

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add real-time call duration display

- Show elapsed time during active calls
- Update UI every second
- Format time as MM:SS

Fixes #123
```

### Kotlin Style Guide
```kotlin
// Class names: PascalCase
class CallTracker {
    
    // Function names: camelCase
    fun startTracking() {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    // Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    companion object {
        private const val DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5000L
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test on different Android versions (API 21+)
- Test on different screen sizes
- Test with different contact list sizes
- Test call tracking accuracy
- Test favorites management

### Automated Testing
We're working on expanding our test coverage. When adding new features:
- Add unit tests for business logic
- Add integration tests for complex interactions
- Update existing tests if you modify behavior

## üì± App Architecture

DialLog follows MVVM architecture:

```
app/src/main/java/com/example/diallog002/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/           # Data models, database, repositories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ managers/       # Business logic managers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Activities, fragments, adapters
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Utility classes and helpers
```

### Key Components
- **ContactManager**: Handles contact operations and favorites
- **CallStateMonitor**: Monitors phone call states
- **CallTracker**: Performs real-time audio analysis
- **CallLogManager**: Manages call history database
